         * This implementation only computes the distance if it's less than or
         * equal to the threshold value, returning -1 if it's greater. The
         * advantage is performance: unbounded distance is O(nm), but a bound of
         * k allows us to reduce it to O(km) time by only computing a diagonal
         * stripe of width 2k + 1 of the cost table. It is also possible to use
         * this to compute the unbounded Levenshtein distance by starting the
         * threshold at 1 and doubling each time until the distance is found;
         * this is O(dm), where d is the distance.
         *
         * One subtlety comes from needing to ignore entries on the border of
         * our stripe eg. p[] = |#|#|#|* d[] = *|#|#|#| We must ignore the entry
         * to the left of the leftmost member We must ignore the entry above the
         * rightmost member
         *
         * Another subtlety comes from our stripe running off the matrix if the
         * strings aren't of the same size. Since string s is always swapped to
         * be the shorter of the two, the stripe will always run off to the
         * upper right instead of the lower left of the matrix.
         *
         * As a concrete example, suppose s is of length 5, t is of length 7,
         * and our threshold is 1. In this case we're going to walk a stripe of
         * length 3. The matrix would look like so:
         *
         * 1 2 3 4 5 1 |#|#| | | | 2 |#|#|#| | | 3 | |#|#|#| | 4 | | |#|#|#| 5 |
         * | | |#|#| 6 | | | | |#| 7 | | | | | |
         *
         * Note how the stripe leads off the table as there is no possible way
         * to turn a string of length 5 into one of length 7 in edit distance of
         * 1.
         *
         * Additionally, this implementation decreases memory usage by using two
         * single-dimensional arrays and swapping them back and forth instead of
         * allocating an entire n by m matrix. This requires a few minor
         * changes, such as immediately returning when it's detected that the
         * stripe has run off the matrix and initially filling the arrays with
         * large values so that entries we don't compute are ignored.
         *
         * See Algorithms on Strings, Trees and Sequences by Dan Gusfield for
         * some discussion.
