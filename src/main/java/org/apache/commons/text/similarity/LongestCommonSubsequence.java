/**
 * A similarity algorithm indicating the length of the longest common subsequence between two strings.
 *
 * <p>
 * The Longest common subsequence algorithm returns the length of the longest subsequence that two strings have in
 * common. Two strings that are entirely different, return a value of 0, and two strings that return a value
 * of the commonly shared length implies that the strings are completely the same in value and position.
 * <i>Note.</i>  Generally this algorithm is fairly inefficient, as for length <i>m</i>, <i>n</i> of the input
 * {@code CharSequence}'s {@code left} and {@code right} respectively, the runtime of the
 * algorithm is <i>O(m*n)</i>.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * As of version 1.10, a more space-efficient of the algorithm is implemented. The new algorithm has linear space
 * complexity instead of quadratic. However, time complexity is still quadratic in the size of input strings.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * The implementation is based on Hirschberg's Longest Commons Substring algorithm (cited below).
 * </p>
