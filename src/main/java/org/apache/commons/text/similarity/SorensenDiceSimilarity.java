/**
 * A similarity algorithm indicating the percentage of matched characters

 * <p>The Sørensen-Dice coefficient is a statistic used for comparing the

 * Thorvald Sørensen and Lee Raymond Dice, who published in 1948 and 1945
 * respectively. The index is known by several other names, especially
 * Sørensen-Dice index, Sørensen index and Dice's coefficient. Other
 * variations include the "similarity coefficient" or "index", such as Dice
 * similarity coefficient (DSC).</p>
