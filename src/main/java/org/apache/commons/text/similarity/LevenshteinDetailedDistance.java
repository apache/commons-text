         * advantage is performance: unbounded distance is O(nm), but a bound of
         * k allows us to reduce it to O(km) time by only computing a diagonal
         * stripe of width 2k + 1 of the cost table. It is also possible to use
         * this to compute the unbounded Levenshtein distance by starting the
         * threshold at 1 and doubling each time until the distance is found;
         * this is O(dm), where d is the distance.
         *
         * One subtlety comes from needing to ignore entries on the border of
         * our stripe eg. p[] = |#|#|#|* d[] = *|#|#|#| We must ignore the entry
         * to the left of the leftmost member We must ignore the entry above the
         * rightmost member
         *
         * Another subtlety comes from our stripe running off the matrix if the
         * strings aren't of the same size. Since string s is always swapped to
         * be the shorter of the two, the stripe will always run off to the
         * upper right instead of the lower left of the matrix.
         *
         * As a concrete example, suppose s is of length 5, t is of length 7,
         * and our threshold is 1. In this case we're going to walk a stripe of
         * length 3. The matrix would look like so:
         *
         * <pre>
         *    1 2 3 4 5
         * 1 |#|#| | | |
         * 2 |#|#|#| | |
         * 3 | |#|#|#| |
         * 4 | | |#|#|#|
         * 5 | | | |#|#|
         * 6 | | | | |#|
         * 7 | | | | | |
         * </pre>
         *
         * Note how the stripe leads off the table as there is no possible way
         * to turn a string of length 5 into one of length 7 in edit distance of
         * 1.
         *
         * Additionally, this implementation decreases memory usage by using two
         * single-dimensional arrays and swapping them back and forth instead of
         * allocating an entire n by m matrix. This requires a few minor
         * changes, such as immediately returning when it's detected that the
         * stripe has run off the matrix and initially filling the arrays with
         * large values so that entries we don't compute are ignored.
         *
         * See Algorithms on Strings, Trees and Sequences by Dan Gusfield for
         * some discussion.

           counts as we iterate through the characters of String s.  Each time we increment
           the index of String t we are comparing, d is copied to p, the second int[].  Doing so
           allows us to retain the previous cost counts as required by the algorithm (taking
           the minimum of the cost count to the left, up one, and diagonally up and to the left
           of the current cost count being calculated).  (Note that the arrays aren't really

           or doing a System.arraycopy() each time  through the outer loop.)
