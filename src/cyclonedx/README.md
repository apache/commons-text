# CycloneDX Documents for Apache Commons Text

The Apache Commons Text project publishes multiple [CycloneDX](https://cyclonedx.org/) documents to help consumers assess the security of their applications using this library:

## SBOM (Software Bill of Materials)

Beginning with version `6.6.0`, Apache Commons Text publishes SBOMs in both **XML** and **JSON** formats to Maven Central. These documents describe all components and dependencies of the library, following standard Maven coordinates:

* **Group ID:** `org.apache.bcel`
* **Artifact ID:** `bcel`
* **Classifier:** `cyclonedx`
* **Type:** `xml` or `json`

Each SBOM lists the libraryâ€™s required and optional dependencies, helping consumers analyze the software supply chain and manage dependency risk.

> [!NOTE]
> The versions listed in the SBOM reflect the dependencies used during the build and test process for that specific release of Text.
> Your own project may use different versions depending on your dependency management configuration.

## VEX (Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange)

An experimental [VEX](https://cyclonedx.org/capabilities/vex/) document is also published:

ðŸ‘‰ [`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/apache/commons-bcel/refs/heads/master/src/cyclonedx/VEX.cyclonedx.xml`](VEX.cyclonedx.xml)

This document provides information about the **exploitability of known vulnerabilities** in the **dependencies** of Apache Commons Text.

### When is a dependency vulnerability exploitable?

Because Apache Commons libraries (including Text) do **not** bundle their dependencies, a vulnerability in a dependency is only exploitable if **both** of the following conditions are true:

1. The vulnerable dependency is included in the consuming project.
2. Apache Commons Text is explicitly listed as affected by the vulnerability.

### Notes and Limitations

* This VEX document is **experimental** and provided **as-is**.
  The semantics of this document may change in the future.
* The **absence** of a vulnerability entry does **not** indicate that Text is unaffected.
* If a version of Text is not listed under the `affects` section of a vulnerability, that version may still be affected or not.
* Only the **latest major version** of Text is currently assessed for vulnerabilities.
* The `analysis` field in the VEX file uses **Markdown** formatting.
