                          Apache Commons Text
                              Version 1.2
                             Release Notes


INTRODUCTION
============

This document contains the release notes for the 1.2 version of Apache Commons
Text. Commons Text is a set of utility functions and reusable components for 
the purpose of processing and manipulating text that should be of use in a Java
environment.

Apache Commons Text is a library focused on algorithms working on strings.


JAVA 9 SUPPORT
==============

At our time of release of 1.2, our build, "mvn clean site," succeeds with
Java 9.0.1 build 9.0.1+11, and we believe all of our features to be Java 9
compatible. However, when we run the build there are substantive warnings
particularly with the maven-changes-plugin:jira-report.

NEW FEATURES
=============

o TEXT-74:   StrSubstitutor: Ability to turn off substitution in values. Thanks to Ioannis Sermetziadis.

JAVA 9 SUPPORT
==============

At our time of release of 1.0, our build succeeds with Java 9-ea build 158,

                        Release Notes for version 1.0-beta-1


A NOTE ON THE HISTORY OF THE CODE
=================================

The codebase began in the fall of 2014 as a location for housing algorithms for
operating on Strings that seemed to have a more complex nature than those which
would be considered a needed extension to java.lang. Thus, a new component,
different from Apache Commons Lang was warranted. As the project evolved, it was
noticed that Commons Lang had considerable more text manipulation tools than
the average Java application developer would need or even want. So, we have
decided to move the more esoteric String processing algorithms out of Commons
Lang into Commons Text.

JAVA 9 SUPPORT
==============

At our time of release of 1.0-beta-1, our build succeeds with Java 9-ea build 153,
and we believe all of our features to be Java 9 compatible.

FIXED BUGS
==========

Note. We recognize the curiosity of a new component having "fixed bugs," but a
considerable number of files were migrated over from Commons Lang, some of which
needed fixes.

o TEXT-62:   Incorporate suggestions from RC2 into 1.0 release.
o TEXT-60:   Upgrading Jacoco for Java 9-ea compatibility. Thanks to Lee Adcock.

             the "left" side string. This would have a method that accepts the
             "right" side string to test. Thanks to Jonathan baker.
o TEXT-8:    Change (R) StringMetric.compare(CS left, CS right) to "apply" so
             that it is consistent with BiFunction. Thanks to Jonathan Baker.
o TEXT-6:    Allow extra information (e.g. Levenshtein threshold) to be stored
             as (final) fields in the StringMetric instance. Thanks to Jonathan
             Baker.
