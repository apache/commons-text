<section name="Getting Involved">
<p>
The <a href="mail-lists.html">commons developer mailing list</a> is the main channel of communication for contributors. Please remember that the lists are shared between all commons components, so prefix your email by [text]. </p>
<p>You can also peruse <a href="issue-tracking.html">JIRA</a>. Specific links of interest for JIRA are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ideas looking for code: <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/issues/?jql=project%20%3D%20TEXT%20AND%20resolution%20%3D%20Unresolved%20AND%20fixVersion%20%3D%20%22Patch%20Needed%22%20ORDER%20BY%20priority%20DESC">Patch Needed</a></li>
<li>Issues with patches, looking for reviews: <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/issues/?jql=fixVersion%20%3D%20%22Review%20Patch%22%20AND%20project%20%3D%20TEXT%20AND%20resolution%20%3D%20Unresolved%20ORDER%20BY%20priority%20DESC">Review Patch</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Alternatively you can go through the <em>Needs Work</em> tags in the <a href="taglist.html">TagList report</a>.</p>
<p>If you'd like to offer up pull requests via GitHub rather than applying patches to JIRA, we have a <a href="https://github.com/apache/commons-text/">GitHub mirror</a>. </p>
