        <detail>
          CVE-2025-48924 is exploitable in Apache Commons Text versions 1.5 and later, but only when all the following conditions are met:

          * The consuming project includes a vulnerable version of Commons Text on the classpath.
            As of version `1.14.1`, Commons Text no longer references a vulnerable version of the `commons-lang3` library in its POM file.
          * Unvalidated or unsanitized user input is passed to the `StringSubstitutor` or `StringLookup` classes.
          * An interpolator lookup created via `StringLookupFactory.interpolatorLookup()` is used.

          If these conditions are satisfied, an attacker may cause an infinite loop by submitting a specially crafted input such as `${const:...}`.

        This document provides information about the **exploitability of known vulnerabilities** in the **dependencies** of Apache Commons Text.

        # When is a dependency vulnerability exploitable?

        Because Apache Commons libraries do **not** bundle their dependencies, a vulnerability in a dependency is only exploitable if **both** of the following conditions are true:

        1. The vulnerable dependency is included in the consuming project.
        2. Apache Commons Text is explicitly listed as affected by the vulnerability.

        # Notes and Limitations

        * This VEX document is **experimental** and provided **as-is**.
          The semantics of this document may change in the future.
        * The **absence** of a vulnerability entry does **not** indicate that Text is unaffected.
        * If a version of Text is not listed under the `affects` section of a vulnerability, that version may still be affected or not.
        * Only the **latest major version** of Text is currently assessed for vulnerabilities.
        * The `analysis` field in the VEX file uses **Markdown** formatting.
